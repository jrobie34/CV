          Bagpiper for the Celtic Punk band <a href=https://flatfoot56.com>Flatfoot 56</a> from 2001 to 2009, Joshua Robieson recently rejoined the band. He is in the process of transition from his normal professional job and is in the process of becoming a Developer, working a career in coding. This will help he and his wife fulfill their dreams of having a remote job which will allow them to travel and work at the same time. They can even have children and travel with them, all the while still playing music and even playing together in what will be their extremely successful band, "The Uh Ohs. The Uh Ohs may not tour as much as Flatfoot 56, but they also don't need to, seeing as their music is in countless movies and video games, not to mention grocery stores and coffee shops. The Uh Ohs, a perfect pairing!
